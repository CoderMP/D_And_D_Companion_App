# **D&D Player Companion App**

***

## **Why Create This Mobile Utility?**
While being a novice D&D player currently, playing the game with my group and having to manage characters using either pen/pencil and paper or editable PDF's, while simple initially, can become rather tedious. On top of that, not everyone is constantly bringing their laptop with them or might forget their character sheet. Initially, I resolved to make a C# UWP app of the same name, but later decided to develop this app as a spiritual successor to hit a larger and more accessible platform. This is why I resolved to develop this mobile app, to act both as a multi-character manager and mini encyclopedia for players both new and experienced.

## **What Can It Do?**
The app itself is broken down into 2 primary sections: Character Management and a small encyclopedia for key aspects of D&D.  

On the side of **Character Management** you can live-edit different character-related categories, such as:
  * General Character Properties (e.g. Health, Race, Class, Background, etc)
  * Character Biography, motivations, flaws, etc
  * Skill levels and Specializations
  * Inventory/Item management

On the side of the **in-app encyclopedia**, you can make quick lookup of topics on:
* The different Races within D&D
  * Player Races
  * Enemy Races
* Player Classes
* Player Backgrounds
* Spells
* Gear
  * Armour
  * Weapons
  * Items/Consumables
* Languages within D&D

feature-related to be integrated into future releases of the app, simply submit an issue ticket with the proper documentation
with your request for approval!
